            Audiences feel a connection to real people and their personal
            stories. Blogs, podcasts, and videos have brought them to a larger
            audience since 2004. And while individual stories can be interesting
            (and hugely popular) in and of themselves, when they’re written from
            multiple people around a common theme and collected in a single
            place, they gain greater ability to inform, influence, educate, or
            entertain. It depends on the publisher’s intent. Here are some
            applied examples.

            While having high-quality, curated, and collected stories is
            important, the audience experience in a media-saturated world
            matters more so. This means having a pleasant visual design in both
            story listings and item pages, and a layout that focuses on the
            primary content and removes all extraneous elements. Secondary
            content, navigation, and additional functionality should be
            carefully designed and placed so they’re not necessarily intuitive,
            but rather available when most helpful and needed.
            <a href="http://medium.com">Medium.com</a> among other examples show
            how visual and interaction design decisions can make reading online
            quite enjoyable.

          <h2 class="story">Project Background</h2>
          <p class="story">
            Since 2012, I’ve enjoyed attending small theatre shows in New York
            City, including the Fringe Festival. Having read about its origins
            in Edinburgh, Scotland after World War II, and that it’s now the
            world’s largest performing arts festival, I wanted to experience it
            firsthand in August 2014. So I went with the intention to both have
            fun and see if I could make some sort of media project out of the
            experience, using responsive web design. This approach uses fluid
            grids, flexible images, and media queries to make visual design and
            layout adjustments when the content is viewed in web browsers on
            different screen sizes. I’ve been very interested in the subject
            since reading a book about it by Ethan Marcotte in 2012, followed by
            learning about frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, and the
            importance of structured content so it can be easily targeted for
            adjustment by CSS and media queries.
          </p>
          <h2 class="story">Original Concept</h2>
          <p class="story">
            At first, my intention was to make some sort of web documentary,
            journalism style. This would include photos, text, and short video
            clips using light and microphone attachments to my DSLR camera, as
            well as my smartphone. With the various media gathered over time,
            some sort of narrative and format would arise. Here’s what I did:
          </p>
          <ul class="story">
            <li>
              Bought ExperiencingFringe.com and created a basic webpage with
              project information, email signup form using Mailchimp, and some
              preliminary media collected.
            </li>
            <li>Designed and printed business cards.</li>
            <li>
              Spoke with, photographed, and audio interviewed performers and
              other staff like journalists, stage managers, and producers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Took photos of posters, street scenes, venues, and small items
              like tickets and brochures.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="story">
            At the end of the fourth day, I had a basic website with preliminary
            media and an email signup form. I then applied with the media
            relations office for a press pass, outlining the project and passing
            along the website. It was rejected. Since I wasn’t going to be
            writing show reviews and didn’t work for an established company, it
            was understandable.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            I also heavily researched web documentaries, their formats, and
            realized I was far in over my head to produce something that
            ambitious. The most I could reasonably foresee viably doing would be
            a long-form article about the festival. But since I didn’t have such
            an assignment with a publication, all I could do would be to
            self-publish on my purchased domain. That didn’t make much sense
            because I would rather have someone read it, in which case it would
            better be served on
            <a href="http://medium.com/@servusmario">my Medium.com account</a>,
            although there I wouldn’t be practicing any web development skills.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            I began questioning the premise of <strong>“Experience”</strong>.
            Whose is it? Writers provide theirs as intermediaries on readers
            behalf. They’ll report facts, detail observations, collect quotes
            and stories, and provide a personal point of view explicitly through
            editorial, or implicitly through chosen and available coverage,
            editing, and the presentation order. For a bigger picture coverage,
            a publication will assemble the work of multiple writers into a
            feature.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            But to get more personal, one has to cut that intermediary and go
            straight to the source.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            I have long been inspired by the documentary storytelling work of
            <a href="https://www.thiswildidea.com/">Theron Humphrey</a> for
            brands like Purina ONE with campaign: "Why We Rescue". It represents
            a viscerally engaging way for the audience to experience multiple
            stories, whichever ones seem most appealing (from a photo and some
            text), and in whatever order they want.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            Although interviews provide a ready structure to guide both
            interviewees and the audience, and generally provide a much faster
            production turnaround time, there’s still an intermediary. For this
            project, I wanted to allow the subjects the freedom to fully express
            themselves and their story. Whatever it is, be it how they became
            interested in becoming a stage manager, the fear and excitement
            actors have before their premiere, or the difficulties and quirks
            with publicizing a show. Although this is merely a prototype with a
            single story, a full production would entail additional
            considerations like contributing writer selection, data workflows,
            editing, and promotion. 
          </p>
          <h2 class="story">The Prototype</h2>
          <p class="story">
            The project could live as a microsite on an existing domain or a
            custom one like FringeStories.com. The site was made with a tool
            called
            <a href="http://typecast.com" class="story-link">Typecast</a>, which
            allowed me to drag and drop in HTML elements, reorder them, add
            breakpoints for variable widths, tryout webfonts from various
            foundries, and adjust properties, create and manage classes, and
            manually edit the CSS.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            I chose a mobile-first site design because I had never done one
            before. This started me off with a fluid design assuming a screen
            smaller than 320 pixels. I then added breakpoints for a minimum
            width of 320, 480, 600, 768, 1024, and 1280 pixels.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            The homepage includes a site navigation at the top, followed by a
            brief description and a list of stories to choose from. None of the
            stories have a title nor subheading because each story is focused on
            an individual and the unique role they played in the festival.
            Secondly, less text decreases readers’ cognitive load and the time
            to make a selection.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            I floated the story items to the left, then adjusted the number of
            stories to show per line by adjust their widths as a percentage of
            their parent container size. So to have 1 story per line I used 100%
            width, 2 at 50%, 3 at 33%, and 4 at 25%.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            The story page is designed to focus the reader’s attention solely on
            the text. I moved the site navigation to the bottom of the page and
            added negative space at the top to provide a breathing room. To
            ensure a comfortable readability, I used only 45-70 characters per
            line by placing asterisks at these points, then adjusting the text
            size and column width at each screen width so only asterisk would
            show on the first line. Additionally, I added sections to include
            contextual information about the story itself, and the writer’s
            background.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            The resulting design was then exported HTML and CSS, further code
            edited in Brackets, and then uploaded to a web server. To date, I’ve
            tested the site on a 13" Macbook Air, iPad Air, iPhone 4S, and a
            Samsung Galaxy S5.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            Not included in the prototype at this time are email subscription
            forms and social sharing buttons on the story page. Additionally,
            the story pages were designed only to hold text. CSS classes would
            have to be built for various photo and audio/video player sizes and
            attributes.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            Lastly, to maximize the probability that each story would equally be
            read, I would have liked to randomize the order of stories listed.
          </p>
          <h2 class="story">A Real Production Scenario</h2>
          <p class="story">
            A small project of this size would be headed by a production manager
            on a part-time basis. Contributing storytellers would be
            individually found through research and network outreach, contacted
            2-3 months before publication, told about the project, and asked if
            they would like to participate. Depending on the nature and
            intention of the project, they would be compensated monetarily or in
            kind. Additionally, a copywriter or editor from within the
            organization or hired as freelance would be necessary.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            Currently the site is simply static HTML and CSS. Although this does
            increase page loading speed, all content management would need to be
            handled by a web developer. If there’s a relatively small, fixed
            number of stories and media types (text, photos, multimedia),
            related content receive final edits, and all the content is
            published in a few intervals, a static website can be okay.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            However if there will potentially be a large number of stories with
            lots of content and mixed media types, the need for on-demand edits,
            and regular interval based publishing, then having a CMS will be
            necessary. Additionally, the benefit of using a database will be
            that the structured content can be migrated elsewhere later.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            In that scenario, a freelance developer would need to be hired to
            customize an existing CMS platform and page templates. For the
            visual design and theme, one can either purchase and customize an
            existing theme from an online store, or hire a freelance designer
            with experience in responsive design.
          </p>
          <p class="story">
            The stories can be published and promoted through communication
            channels individually when they receive final edits. This approach
            is particularly effective as part of a long term campaign, in which
            case it is best to launch with 3-5 finished stories. Every week for
            example, email subscribers and social media supporters would receive
            a new story, providing a consistent and meaningful connection to the
            publisher, organization, or cause. If there’s under 20 stories total
            though, I believe one can also publish them all at once and promote
            them either individually or as a collection.
          </p>
