          <p class="story">
            I arrived just under a week ago to the Waverly Station, Edinburgh.
            With three bags (I don't know how I managed to bring so many
            things), I trudged up the stairs headed to the station's southern
            exit and weaseled my phone out of my pocket, fired up the MapsWithMe
            app, and pinch/zoomed a mental path of street names, rights and
            lefts, to the apartment where I'd be subletting a room for August.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Going up an alley called a &quot;Close&quot; then another called a
            &quot;Wynd&quot;, I eventually found my way to Valleyfield street.
            But what was this street number &quot;3/4&quot; all about? Like
            normal cities, even numbers were on one side, odds on the other. I
            found building 3 but without Joy's last name on any of the buzzers.
            Frustrated, I asked a pedestrian group for help and they said
            &quot;Oh, that means building 3, flat number 4&quot;. Aha. Just a
            cultural thing about symbols. Up the stairs and a knock later, Matt
            answers the door and welcomes me in, I unload the bags in my room,
            and chill out in the kitchen with him and drink some tea. Like his
            girlfriend Joy, they both recently graduated with a Bachelors in
            Journalism and have taken on paid internships for the festival.
            Matt's working for an online magazine of <i>The Scotsman</i> and
            tells me tomorrow is media day at Fringe Central, where various
            performers pitch their shows to media outlets, and it might be
            interesting to check out.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            After settling in the room, it's getting late and it's best to head
            out and check out the streets. East on Grassmarket street and up
            around the West Bow, I had a drink at the Underbelly and bought a
            ticket for Spank, a midnight comedy show with two lively hosts who
            also made us dance to a pop song, <i>Mr.Brightside</i>, and
            <i>Don't Stop Believing</i>.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            The next day I finally meet flatmate Joy, who I first met on Skype a
            few weeks earlier to confirm her apartment was legit before I
            paypal-ed the deposit funds. We get to know each other over tea
            (realizing this is a trend), and she mentions a traditional Scottish
            dance tomorrow night to which she has extra tickets.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            I head out to Fringe Central with camera and lenses in tow, taking
            shots of performers in line for each media outlet. Some are all
            dressed up, most aren't. The air is a mix of nervous of excited as
            you can see it in people's faces. I interview some people, and head
            over to the media office asking about how to get press
            accreditation.
          </p>

          </p>

          <p class="story">
            There are posters. <b>Everywhere</b>. And it's a little
            overwhelming, but you get used to it and come to appreciate the art
            direction in many. And somehow or another, the ones that grab your
            attention just right, make you check out their description when
            you're browsing the show catalog later on. I end up taking lots of
            pictures of them for some collage or slideshow.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Sunday I had a free ticket for a show but got the location all
            wrong, which happens, and so in these situations, especially in
            semi-rainy weather, you buy a ticket for the next show, which in
            this case is <i>First World Problems</i>, a humorous critique on
            social media and the absurdity of people's gripes on petty
            annoyances in everyday life.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            You realize that while worthwhile, paying $17 USD (converted from an
            already unfortunate pound-to-dollar exchange rate) for what appears
            to be a student production is steep, and that while taking risks on
            shows is part of the &quot;experience&quot;, let's be more judicious
            next time.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            After getting my phone activated with a new sim, I head out to meet
            Joy at Assembly George Square in a tent called Spiegeltent Palazzo,
            with a lot of direction asking until I arrive. This is Ceilidh
            (pronounced like the name Kailey), featured traditional Scottish
            folk music and dance. The instructors/showmen get people to have a
            good time. I shoot pictures and video but don't feel like joining
            in.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Monday morning. I want to get my press accreditation but also want
            to present the website as having some kind of supporting material to
            work off of, not wanting to appear like someone who just wants to
            attend shows for free. So I gather the material from the media pitch
            day including photos and audio interviews, curate and edit, throw up
            a page using Dreamweaver, edit and upload poster photos to a Flickr
            album, and update the homepage with links to both. UPS guy shows up
            at the door with business cards for the project, I get excited,
            finish the online application with an explanation of the web
            documentary project, and head out the door.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            At the media centre, I explain to a staffer about my application,
            project, and he says I should hear back by tomorrow. So I go buy
            tickets 3 shows for tonight. <i>Ablutions</i> was a slightly dark
            story about a bartender in LA, the relationship with his girlfriend
            and colleagues, and dealing with alcoholism and escape. I then head
            over to the Assembly Main Hall to see <i>The Factory</i>, an
            endearing musical from New Zealand about Samoan workers in a garment
            factory, the hardships endured, their collective bond, and the hopes
            for a better life. And topping off the night was
            <i>50 Shades: The Musical</i>, an absolutely hilarious spoof of the
            <i>50 Shades of Grey</i> novel.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Tuesday. Judgement day for accreditation. And the verdict email
            comes in the afternoon as I'm walking the streets,
            &quot;...unfortunately you have not been successful in...&quot;.
            Damn. Bummer. Shit. What do I do now? A pain weighs heavily inside,
            realizing somehow I will adapt. What chance did I really have
            anyway, considering I had no history in web documentaries, nor
            produce media for an established outlet of some kind?
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            While in line to buy tickets for a show, a lady who's going to see a
            stand-up comedian in 30 minutes offers me a free ticket. Like 90% of
            all comedians here, he's British and funny at times (despite my
            relative downtrodden demeanour). The thing about humor is that most
            often 30-40% of the material is culturally tied to the comedian's
            country. So politicians, talk show hosts, musicians, and quirks
            about everyday life in that country will leave you, the foreigner,
            with a blank face waiting for the act to be funny again.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            I head out to see another show, <i>Hunter and Johnny</i>, about the
            origins of Johnny Depp's friendship with gonzo journalist Hunter S.
            Thompson while preparing for playing the role of Hunter in the 1997
            film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Johnny greeted us as we
            entered the theatre (or rather section of the church building where
            quite a few Fringe shows are hosted). It's funny, Hunter is
            eccentric, and I take a picture of the two actors after the show's
            over. Flatmates in London, they had worked on the show idea for a
            while, and pieced together a narrative from news clippings and
            interview clips with Johnny Depp. Having taken courses in New and
            Gonzo Journalism, they only found it apt to portray the friendship
            Johnny and Hunter developed.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Wednesday. Sleeping in and not wanting to feel the verdict's bitter
            disappointment, I head out to see <i>Blood at the Root</i>, a play
            about high school students and race relations in a Louisiana town.
            Well written and performed it captured the angst, hopes, awkward
            feelings and conversations on skin color and identity, the
            difficulty in identifying cause and effect in provocations and
            fights, and the bias towards prosecuting black Americans with far
            higher offences. The impact of the show experienced, as opposed to
            sound bites, reminded me of online discussions I've seen in the last
            year, whether regarding equality and race relations in the U.S.,
            France, or in Israel. Regardless of your ethnic background, your
            daily experiences influence your perceptions, and cannot represent
            an overall sentiment on the ways things are. Nationalists and bigots
            are everywhere. As are egalitarians. And everyone in between.
            Violence and fear can only bring it out further.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            The Fringe also hosts events to help performers, like
            <i
              >Be a Media Darling: How to Make the Press Love You and Come Back
              for More</i
            >, which I attended that afternoon. In a standard university fare
            lecture hall, Elaine Liner talked about journalists as human beings
            who are lazy, underpaid, overworked, but like producing good
            stories. And with tips including targeting the correct writer,
            crafting great emails, attaching only photos and absolutely under no
            circumstances PDFs, her charm and love for coaching came out well.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            It was time to start saving money on these show tickets by visiting
            the Half-Price Hut, open from 10-9 everyday. Thing is, you need to
            know what's on sale today and since there's so many shows, it's
            impossible to print out or display on a billboard. I don't know how
            others managed, but I fired up my mobile app and checked out the
            listings. Which unfortunately refreshes every 26 seconds, meaning
            swipe scrolls back down to the time you were interested in. Very
            annoying.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            I end up first seeing <i>Abigoliah Schamaun</i>, a New York comic
            who recently moved to London, talked about with the aid of a big
            screen slideshow, her funny childhood, sexual adventures, and more.
            Next up was the <i>Soweto Spiritual Sisters</i> from South Africa,
            who as you probably guessed, sang a lot of gospel in various
            outfits. Next was <i>Fire in the Meth Lab</i>, a solo show about an
            Australian man's growing up with his mean, older brother. And to top
            the night off was a guided <i>Terror Tour</i> of the city including
            where public executions took place, a gallery of torture and
            punishment devices, and haunted vaults beneath the old city bridge.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Thursday was a rest day. Reconsider everything day. Feeling 'Showed
            Out'. I read some more of <i>The Four Pillars of Self-Esteem</i>,
            realise where I am and where I don't want to be, talk to Charlie for
            a bit, go for a run, and start watching season 4 of
            <i>Game of Thrones</i>.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Friday. It's time to start synthesising the media to date. The
            Fringe is a very personal experience depending on what you're drawn
            to. Without any data to back it up, I'd say most people are casual
            attendees and see 3-5 shows. When looking at the catalog and
            listings, it seems like 40% of all shows are comedy, which might be
            free to attend especially if they're hosted in a pub.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            The Half Price Hut is a godsend, although seeing what's available is
            a bit of a pain. You can either go there in person, look at the LED
            screen, then look up the show name and description in the printed
            catalog. Or use the mobile app from anywhere, which most annoyingly
            refreshes the listings view every 25 seconds and you have to rapidly
            scroll back all the way down to the hour, minutes you were looking.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Sometimes the show descriptions are quite ambiguous and you honestly
            don't know what the hell it's about, only that the company is
            perhaps 'innovative' and 'provocative', and perhaps some reviewers'
            anecdotes and maybe some number of stars. So with that, you take a
            risk. And it may be absolutely worthwhile. Or a complete waste of
            time and money. But therein lies the unexpected, the unanticipated.
            Will it be a joyful surprise or an absolute dud? I took that
            unknown-plot-chance Saturday with <i>Show 6</i>, from a London
            company and there was something about a man having run over a chav
            (British slang for poor trashy person), while driving through a
            flavella (are we in Brazil now?), he and his friend's search for
            their real parents following the coup many years ago. Oh boy, I
            stopped trying to make sense of the near-Vonnegut story and just
            admired the acting instead.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Next was <i>Brazouka</i>, a dance show about a young Brazilian man's
            journey from fishing with his dad to becoming a dancer and moving to
            Paris. Having seen very few dances before, I was captivated by the
            performers alternating between samba, lambada, capoeira, acrobatics
            reminiscent of high school cheer, and the playing along as part of
            each act. Combined with the music, sound effects, and occasional
            projections, it was remarkable.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Then came the sexy, international criminal, surveillance, and
            undercover agent drama <i>Notoriously Yours</i>. Debuting at the
            Adelaide Fringe and making its way here, its film noir style
            combined with modern elements including mobile phones and hookup app
            Tinder, gave you a thrilling undercurrent.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Coming to the Fringe wouldn't be complete without seeing a Cabaret
            show. Lady Rizo gave songs, comedy, interacted with the audience,
            and gave us her story of having started as a lounge singer on a
            cruise, to moving to New York with her Latin husband, an
            open-marriage, and how love and lust couldn't keep them together in
            the long run.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            Took two big chances yesterday. The first was a spoken word show
            <i>Title and Deed</i>, where at first I thought the actor had
            forgotten his topics, was a simple and scatterbrained person, but it
            was all in character. Awkward. But maybe that's another form of
            British humour. The next was <i>Before Us</i> which was a hilarious,
            sometimes melancholy, and endearing one-man show combining a
            keyboard operetta with a story about a last-of-his-species creature
            in the forest, going to a party, making out with a bird, and
            climbing a tree where he sees an apparition of his father. Absurd
            but incredibly funny, he had us all hold hands a couple times and
            sing along to what at times felt like a simple and sweet
            <i>Arcade Fire</i> song was playing in the background.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            The <i>Chronic Single's Handbook</i> was a spoken word piece on a
            Boston man's trip around the world and not finding much luck in love
            on the road, with reflections on dating experiences and
            relationships back home, before ending with a note of being ready to
            settle into what may come, without the pressure of wanting to
            'date'.
          </p>

          <p class="story">
            <i>The Sake</i> was a Japanese dance and theatrics piece with
            elaborate costumes, acrobatics, and sound. <i>Tape</i> had two old
            friends who meet in a hotel room with lots of awkwardness and
            confessions around a date rape incident years ago.
          </p>
